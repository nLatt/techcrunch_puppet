With two accomplices named in a separate federal indictment, Clark — who went by the online handle “Kirk” — allegedly used the tool to hijack the accounts of dozens of celebrities and public figures, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk and former president Barack Obama, to post a cryptocurrency scam netting over $100,000 in bitcoin in just a few hours.\n\nIt was, by all accounts, a sophisticated attack that required technical skills and an ability to trick and deceive to pull off the scam. Some security professionals were impressed, comparing the attack to one that had the finesse and professionalism of a well-resourced nation-state attacker.\n\nBut a profile in The New York Times describes Clark was an “adept scammer with an explosive temper.”\n\nIn the teenager’s defense, the attack could have been much worse. Instead of pushing a scam that promised to “double your money,” Clark and his compatriots could have wreaked havoc. In 2013, hackers hijacked the Associated Press’ Twitter account and tweeted a fake bomb attack on the White House, sending the markets plummeting — only to quickly recover after the all-clear was given.\n\nBut with control of some of the world’s most popular Twitter  accounts, Clark was for a few hours in July one of the most powerful people in the world. If found guilty, the teenager could spend his better years behind bars.\n\nHere’s more from the past week.\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\nGarmin hobbles back after ransomware attack, but questions remain","article_featured_image_src":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/decrypted-whittaker.jpg?w=730&crop=1"}
